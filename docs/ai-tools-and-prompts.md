Create a Python function that processes Hebrew text from PDF documents, handles RTL text direction, and extracts hierarchical paragraph structures using regex patterns. The function should:

1. Handle both PDF and DOCX formats
2. Normalize Hebrew text for consistent processing
3. Extract paragraph numbers and text content
4. Create a hierarchical JSON structure
5. Handle encoding issues and special characters
6. Include comprehensive error handling

Use the python-docx and pdfplumber libraries. The output should be a nested dictionary with authority names as keys and paragraph structures as values.
```

#### Business Logic Implementation

1. Accept business profile (size, seats, features)
2. Match against regulatory requirements
3. Calculate relevance scores based on multiple factors
4. Handle Hebrew text matching
5. Support dynamic feature loading from JSON
6. Include comprehensive validation

Use type hints and include docstrings. The matching algorithm should consider:
